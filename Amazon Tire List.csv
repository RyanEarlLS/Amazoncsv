Designed for SUVs and light trucks, these durable all-season tires are at home on the highway and in light snow. Plus, they promise good tread life backed by a 50,000-mile warranty. As those miles roll by, the footprint and tread design help promote even treadwear for a consistent appearance and year-round performance.

Confidence LT-S tires offer more without breaking the bank, including four deep grooves that effectively evacuate water to keep you in control and resist hydroplaning. Rounding out the many features is the five-rib tread design for a safe, smooth, and quiet ride.

Features and Benefits
- Balance of performance and value
- All-season M+S rating
- Good tread life backed by a 50,000-mile warranty"
